This is a final project I did for a C++ basics course in 2022. 

It is a simple hotel room booking system. The user can choose their room number or it can be randomly assigned. The program checks if
the room is available. The user can also choose one bedroom or two bedroom room and how many nights they are staying. The program
announces the price after a possible discount.
